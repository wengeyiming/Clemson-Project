a) The functionality of my work: The project I implement has these function: Users can use 1,2,3,4,5 on the keyboard to control the cube's location to the 5 joints. Users can use q,w,e,a,s,d to control the rotation on 6 degrees. The cube's position and rotation are calculated by Matrix and Quaternion. The scene also shows the information about global positon of the cube, global rotation in Euler angles and Quaternions, and the transformation matrix of the cube.

b) My implementation: There are three major problems I need to solve£ºFirst is to get input from keyboard and implement rotation with right joint, second is to calculate the right position and rotation of the cube, third is to show the required information on the scene. I put the keyboard input listener in the update() function, though this was maybe not good but I couldn't find a better way to implement it. I also used the knowledge I learned from previous project to implement the information show. The main problem I met in this project was how to calculate the position of the cube correctly . I read the API about Matrix4*4 and Quaternion on Unity website but I could just calculate the cube position correctly when it was on joint2. I read the pdf carefully and I believed my calculation method was right. When it came to a deadlock I suddenly noticed that I should use localEulerAngles rather than EulerAngles and my problem was solved.
