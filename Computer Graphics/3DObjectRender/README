You can change the OBJ file path in OBJAttribute.h  #define FILE_PATH "model1.obj"

I implemented all three extra tasks though some render results seem strange. You can see the render results in snapShot. model3.obj is the object that has more than 3 sides.

Vector3f.hpp defines the 3d vectors’ attribute and their basic operation.

Material.hpp defines the Phong materials attribute.

Ray.hpp defines attributes of the ray.

Camera.hpp defines camera information

RGBColor defines color attributes and color’s operation.

TSample defines when a light hits a triangle sample, how to calculate intersection information and how to get the color in the triangle when use different render method.
