Project no: No.5

Project due date: April 20, 2018, 8 a.m.

Project description: In this project, I will incorporate more action and interaction into my animation so that it includes projectiles, explosions, and an object pool. My goal should be to develop a consistent theme because in the next project my game must reach a reasonable conclusion. Now there is a soilder in my project who can fire bulltes, and some fishes which will explode if hit by bullet. The soilder has three lives and will lost one life if he touches the fish.


The easiest part of this project: Design different type of sprites I used in this game.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Fix the memory leak problem.
